# IntegrityPerformanceTool
Project to build a java application which can read the Integrity Server Statistics and Server Metrics files, 
organize them into a data model, and output the information into reports.

This project is still in its infancy, and the README will be updated with more details as the application 
becomes usable over time.

Current Status:
The IntegrityStatisticBean, IntegirtyMetricBean, and StatisticsColleciton classes are completed. 
Next goal is to complete testing for the StatisticsCollection class and begin thinking about how to design the logging, error logging, and exception handling for these classes.
