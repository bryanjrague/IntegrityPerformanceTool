# IntegrityPerformanceTool
Project to build a java application which can read the Integrity Server Statistics and Server Metrics files, 
organize them into a data model, and output the information into reports.

This project is still in its infancy, and the README will be updated with more details as the application 
becomes usable over time.

Current Status:
The basic data model of the program has been created and tested. Next, the file readers and parsers will be configured to read the Server statistics and Server metrics files, store the data into the data model, and prepare them for reporting.

Finally, the reporting mechanism of the program will be constructed for proof of concept.
